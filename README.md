# brownian
This is a generic Brownian Dynamics code for colloidal and granular systems

First version: no optimization
2D system of point like-particles
Each particle has x,y,fx,fy, q, color
Initialization: random initialization
Periodic Boundary condition in both x,y directions
1/r^2 exp(-r/r0) repulsion between particles
q*fx0 driving force in the x direction
